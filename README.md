    <h1>Thirty Days Data Engineering Challenge - 8th Day</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the repository for the 8th day of the Thirty Days Data Engineering Challenge. This project focuses on fraud transaction detection using a dataset from a bank.</p>

    <h2>Project Structure</h2>
    <pre>
├── .ipynb_checkpoints
│   └── (Jupyter notebook checkpoints)
├── Fraud Transaction Detection.ipynb
├── bank.csv
├── bank.xlsx
    </pre>

    <h3>Files</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fraud Transaction Detection.ipynb</strong>: Jupyter notebook containing the code and explanations for fraud transaction detection.</li>
        <li><strong>bank.csv</strong>: CSV file containing the bank transaction data.</li>
        <li><strong>bank.xlsx</strong>: Excel file containing the bank transaction data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>The goal of this project is to detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes various features related to bank transactions, and we aim to identify which transactions are potentially fraudulent.</p>

    <h3>Steps Involved</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Data Exploration</strong>: Understanding the structure and characteristics of the dataset.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Preprocessing</strong>: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Feature Engineering</strong>: Creating new features that may help in improving the model's performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Training</strong>: Training machine learning models to detect fraud.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Evaluation</strong>: Evaluating the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.</li>
        <li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Summarizing the findings and potential improvements.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>To run this project, you need to have Jupyter Notebook installed along with the necessary Python libraries. You can install the required libraries using:</p>
    <pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>
    <p>Then, you can start Jupyter Notebook by running:</p>
    <pre><code>jupyter notebook</code></pre>
    <p>Open the <code>Fraud Transaction Detection.ipynb</code> file to view and execute the code.</p>

    <h2>Dataset</h2>
    <p>The dataset used in this project is provided in two formats:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>bank.csv</strong>: A CSV file containing the transaction data.</li>
        <li><strong>bank.xlsx</strong>: An Excel file containing the transaction data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can find these files in the repository.</p>
